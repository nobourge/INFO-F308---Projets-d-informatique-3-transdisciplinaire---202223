# The programs has 2 steps:
# 1. Training our models and get the results
# 2. Visualize those results

# Training (with PyGad)
# Each creature has a genome, in our case
# this genome defines the force to apply on a joint
# at a certain moment in time.
# For each solution proposed by PyGad, we are going to
# modify the base genome of this creature. Then this
# creature is going to be put in the simulation environment
# and the fitness of this solution will be calculated.
# Sensor data should be gathered for each step of the simulation
# giving us more possibility on how to compute the fitness value

# best parameters for our case from similar pygad examples are:
# population_size=100,
# num_generations=50,
# num_parents_mating=4,
# mutation_percent_genes=10,
# num_joints=4,
# parallel_processing=None,

# random_mutation_min_val=-1000,
# random_mutation_max_val=1000,

# keep_elitism=1,
