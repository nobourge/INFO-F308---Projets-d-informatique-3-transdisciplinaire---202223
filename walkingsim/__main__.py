# todo : for each creature generation group : parallelize the creation
#  of each creature
#  - graph pygad
#  - simulation pychrono

# The programs has 2 steps:
# 1. Training our models and get the results
# 2. Visualize those results

# Training (with PyGad)
# Each creature has a genome, in our case
# this genome defines the force to apply on a joint
# at a certain moment in time.
# For each solution proposed by PyGad, we are going to
# modify the base genome of this creature. Then this
# creature is going to be put in the simulation environment
# and the fitness of this solution will be calculated.
# Sensor data should be gathered for each step of the simulation
# giving us more possibility on how to compute the fitness value
