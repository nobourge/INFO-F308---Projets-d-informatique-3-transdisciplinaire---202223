    Representing a creature genotype as a directed graph.

    Nodes describe bones and have the following attributes:
        dimensions - 3-tuple with 3d size of the body part
        joint_type - joint type that sets constraints on relative motion
                    between the part and its parent
        recursive_limit - int stating how many times a phenotype should
                         add this part if adding it several times recursively
        neurons -

    Edges describe connections between a parent and a child node and have the
    following attributes:
        position - 3d position of attachment of a child to its parent, constrained
                  to be on the parent's surface
        orientation - an orientation matrix based on the child's parent
        scale - a scale matrix based on the child's parent
        reflection - a reflection matrix based on the child's parent
        terminal_only - boolean flag, which when set to True allows the connection
                       to be applied only when the recursive_limit of a node is
                       reached, for hand or tail-like parts
